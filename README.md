In January 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46364689) on the postcode lottery of council charges to collect unwanted furniture and other large waste items.

Data was gathered and analysed from 391 councils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and we found:

* Prices across the UK range from just a few pounds for a single item to £44. For multiple items, charges go up to £100 in some areas
* Householders in the south of England have to pay on average three times as much as those in the North East, the cheapest region for bulky waste
* A quarter of councils in England have extra charges to collect white goods
* Only a third of councils in England offer reductions for pensioners, disabled residents or people on benefits
* Only 15 councils in England currently provide free bulky waste collections, while half of local authorities in Northern Ireland do not charge

The average price per item at first collection:
* England £11
* Wales £6
* Scotland £6
* Northern Ireland £2
